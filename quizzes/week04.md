# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
asynchronous returns a promise and waits on data and code will still run while it waits, whereas synchronous code depends on the code running in a linear path

```
**2.** What is an event listener?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
**7.** What does the `API` acronym stand for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
**8.** In the `MVC` design pattern, who is responsible for making calls to `APIs`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
services
```
**9.** What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
it makes your functions anonymous, so the only functions that are accessible are the ones directly linked to the app.js, and everything else is only referenced and passed onto other parts of the code

```
**10.** What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
**11.** What is a 500 error?
