## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

- protects functions and data

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
- leads to breaking changes because of naming conventions

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
- you can have variables outside of the function that you are calling with encapsulation and this makes it prrivate because no one will be able to see the value of the variable unless they have all of the code
