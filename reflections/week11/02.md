## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
A primary key is used to ensure data in the specific column is unique. A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables.
2. What is an `Alias`?
an Alias just allows us to assign a name to something else, typically its to make typing more straight forward
3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:
SELECT patient.*,
doctor.*
From patients patient
join doctors doctor on doctor.id = patient.doctorId
where patient.doctorId = @doctorId
GROUP BY doctor.id

```SQL
is this right???
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

-- CREATE TABLE patients (
--   id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
--   -- CODE OMITTED
--   PRIMARY KEY (id)
-- )

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
