# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? we got pretty far on our capstone
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise? omit on documents is no fun
- What are you struggling with? .remove() not being a function
- What would you count as a victory?
