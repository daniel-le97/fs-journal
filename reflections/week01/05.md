# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?
- html and css/bootstrap were pretty easy to get the hang of so theres that.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
- coding is as hard as i thought it would be
- What are you struggling with?
- organization on my workspace
- What would you count as a victory?
- i was able to finish most products in class or be 80% done, only problem is i would try messing with it after and i didn't commit before doing so, making me have to spend more time on it.
